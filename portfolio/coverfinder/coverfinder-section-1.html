Boat covers are a made-to-order product, unlike most products in the marine industry and most products sold on the internet.
<br /><br />
With 40,000+ boat models from 600 boat manufacturers, cataloging all the possibilities from each cover manufacturer into an easy-to-use shopping experience is no easy task.
<br /><br />
<a href='http://boatcovers.iboats.com/' target='_blank'>iboats.com CoverFinder</a> is the world's #1 cover sales engine. With over 150,000 combinations of boats and matching cover patterns, no other cover website can match it in functionality or scope. 
And since all competing products are shown to consumers simultaneously, a purchasing decision can be made more efficiently, dramatically increasing conversions.
<br /><br />
Additionally, each product sku is built dynamically at order-time, using consumer-specified boat stats, fabric and colors; this greatly reduces the number of products that need to be databased and updated.
<br /><br />
I built the entire proprietary software stack that powers the CoverFinder, from the relational database design, to the Perl-powered dynamic HTML generation, to the CSS and Javascript front-end,
as well as a full suite of administration tools that allow the product manager to keep it up to date."
